    abstract: |
        We describe an algorithm for barrier synchronization that requires
        only read and write to shared store. The algorithm is faster than
        the traditional locked counter approach for two processors and has
        an attractive log2N time scaling for larger N. The algorithm is
        free of hot spots and critical regions and requires a shared memory
        bandwidth which grows linearly with N, the number of participating
        processors. We verify the technique using both a real shared memory
        multiprocessor, for numbers of processors up to 30, and a shared
        memory multiprocessor simulator, for numbers of processors up to 256.
