= Objectives <objectives>
The main goal of this thesis is to research, compare, and potentially, invent distributed barrier
synchronization algorithms using the hybrid programming model. Specifically:

- Survey existing barrier synchronization algorithms in related programming
  models.
- Implements variants of barrier synchronization algorithms in the hybrid programming model.
- Compare the performance of the implemented barrier algorithms with existing
  algorithms.
- Propose methods to deploy selected barrier algorithms on the current HPC system.

= Scope <scope>

The scope of this Specialization Project, the project aims to provide and familiarize
the author with new concepts and programming paradigms. The details are as follows:
- Explore key concepts in high-performance computing (HPC).
- Study MPI-3 and its programming model.
- Investigate C++11 threading and concurrency features.
- Research the hybrid programming model combining MPI-3 and C++11.
- Survey existing barrier synchronization algorithms.
- Implement a simple barrier synchronization algorithm with the hybrid model.
