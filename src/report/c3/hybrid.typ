= Hybrid Parallelization Approaches <hybrid>
Quaranta and Maddegedara @quaranta-mpi proposed a novel hybrid approach
combining MPI-3 shared memory windows with C11/C++11 memory model. Their work
demonstrates several key advantages:
- Efficient intranode communication using MPI shared memory windows
- Fine-grained synchronization using C++11 atomic operations
- Reduced variance in execution times
- Enhanced synchronization between processes, especially in multi-node
  environments
- Significant performance improvements in ghost updates compared to flat MPI
- More efficient synchronization of shared data compared to RMA-based methods
