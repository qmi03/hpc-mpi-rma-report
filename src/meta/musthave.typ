First, I want to express my gratitude to my school and teachers for providing me
with a strong foundation in the field of computer science and software
engineering. Their guidance has helped me refine my skills and develop my
mindset as an engineer and scientist. These experiences have not only supported
me in this specialized project but will also guide me throughout my lifelong
journey.

I am especially thankful to my mother and brother for their unwavering support
during both good times and bad. They have always been there for me, offering
emotional and financial support and being the pillars I can rely on when times
are tough.

I would also like to extend my deepest gratitude to Mr. Diệp Thanh Đăng for
inspiring me and guiding me toward this research topic. His mentorship helped me
discover my true passion and led me to choose this meaningful topic for my
thesis.
