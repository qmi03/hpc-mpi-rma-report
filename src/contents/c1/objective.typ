== Brief overview
Research and develop distributed barrier synchronization algorithms using the
hybrid programming model.

== Details
The specific objectives of this report are as follows:
- Explore key concepts in high-performance computing (HPC).
- Study MPI-4.1 and its programming model.
- Investigate C++11 threading and concurrency features.
- Research the hybrid programming model combining MPI-4.1 and C++11.
- Survey existing barrier synchronization algorithms in related programming
  models.
- Analyze and identify promising barrier algorithms for implementation.
- Propose methods to deploy selected barrier algorithms on the current HPC system.
