= Conclusions
== Accomplishments
- Studied and familiarized myself with MPI and its One-Sided Communication techniques
- Explored C++11 threading and concurrency features
- Successfully implemented the two-process Brooks barrier algorithm utilizing
  MPI's Remote Memory Access (RMA) Operations
== Challenges and Learnings
=== Initial Challenges:
- Faced a steep learning curve with parallel programming concepts.
- Extensive effort required to comprehend the MPI standard documentation and its historical context.
=== Key Learnings:
- Gained a robust understanding of memory models and synchronization techniques.
- Developed insight into one-sided communication mechanics in MPI.
=== Adaptation Effort:
- Adapting Brookâ€™s barrier algorithm to distributed memory was straightforward but required a comprehensive system understanding.
=== Outcomes:
- Established a solid foundation in distributed memory systems and synchronization strategies.
- Successfully adapted the two-process barrier algorithm to distributed memory.
- Future Opportunities:
- Yet to implement a fully functional barrier algorithm for hybrid memory models.
-	Room for further exploration and development in this domain.
== Future Works
=== Plan
- Understanding of C++ and MPI Memory model to implement C++ and MPI Hybrid model
- Adapting and Implementing barrier algorithms using MPI's One-Sided Communication
- Testing of proposed algorithms on existing clusters
- Performance benchmarking
